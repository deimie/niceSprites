        This is a 2D sprite test programmed in HTML & JS and rendered with jekyll. 
        The "playground" page lets you control a character with full movement mechanics and animations. 
        The "spritesheet" page simply displays every sprite that the character uses in their animations.
        The "code" page displays and explains the code behind this project.
